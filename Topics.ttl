# Topics. Information about the topics that are covered in a course:
# 1. The topic’s name
#            as mentioned in the source material (e.g., “DL” might be mentioned in an
#            outline, referring to “deep learning”)
# 2. Topics must have provenance information,
#            that is, you must record where the topic was identified as being covered in the course (e.g., the (graduate) calendar, the course outline or a
#            specific lecture)
# 3. A topic must be linked to DBpedia and/or Wikidata.
#            For example, the topic “Knowledge graph” in a course description
#            could be linked to https://dbpedia.org/resource/Knowledge graph.
