Worksheet #5: Introduction to Machine Learning

Task 1. A quick refresher: Based on the output below, compute precision@k = 1
k ·

k∑
c=1

rel(c) for the three

recommender systems (for k = 1, 2, 3):

System@k precision@k

1 2 3 1 2 3

system 1 7 7 3

system 2 7 3 3

system 3 3 3 3

Task 2. Here is a dataset of documents with two attributes, to be grouped into two clusters. Apply
k-Means clustering, by computing the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =

√∑n
i=1(pi − qi)2 of each data point to

the two initial centröıds and assigning each document to its closest cluster:

Centröıd

a1 a2

Cluster 1 1.0 1.0

Cluster 2 5.0 7.0

a1 a2 Distance to C1 Distance to C2 Cluster Tag

Doc1 1.5 2.0 #Travel

Doc2 3.0 4.0 #Food

Doc3 4.5 5.0 #Travel

Doc4 3.5 4.5 #Food

(Ignore the “Tag” column for now, we’ll use it in the next question!)

Task 3. Now apply the kNN classification algorithm on the new document below to determine its tag. Use
k = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =

√∑n
i=1(pi − qi)2 (just like for k-Means-clustering):

a1 a2 d-Doc1 d-Doc2 d-Doc3 d-Doc4 Tag?

Doc5 2.5 3.5

You can now auto-assign a tag to the new document based on a majority vote of the k nearest neighbors.

here p vector is Doc5 
        q vector is d-Doc1 or d-Doc2 or ... or  etc.

Tags = Travel, Food, Food

Food = 2 

Travel = 1

# Food

Task 4. Should we invest $100m in producing this new movie? We’ll use machine learning to predict the
rating (1–5 stars) of a movie, by applying the regression version of the kNN algorithm. Here’s our training
data:

# Movie Length #Zombies #Explosions Rating

1 Movie 1 135 0 5 FFF

2 Movie 2 90 123 2 FFFFF

3 Movie 3 159 2 1 F

4 Movie 4 109 5 3

To find the predicted rating for Movie #4, first find the two nearest neighbors (i.e., k = 2), using the same
calculation as before:

d( ~m4, ~m1) = d( ~m4, ~m2) = d( ~m4, ~m3) = =⇒ Closest = ,

Now, compute the average of the ratings of the k nearest movies for k = 2 (convert the ? rating into a value
in [1...5]): This is your predicted rating for Movie 4!

Task 5. Here are three different systems that classified 500 data items:

Last time, we already calculated Precision and Recall for these systems (you can verify that the alternative
formulas here give you the same results). Now, compute the Accuracy and F1-Measure:

Accuracy =
TP + TN

P + N

Recall =
TP

TP + FN

Precision =
TP

TP + FP

F1 =
2 · Precision · Recall
Precision + Recall

system 1 system 2 system 3

Precision n/a 1.0 0.71

Recall 0 0.6 1.0

Accuracy

F1-Measure

19.026                                 50.13                                m1          m2

( 3 + 5 ) / 2 = 4 star rating for movie 4
