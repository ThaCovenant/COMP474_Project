Intelligent Conversational Agents
a.k.a. Dialog System or Dialog Engine

• A software program that can interpret and
respond to statements made by users in a
natural language

• Different types of chatbots
• Generic vs. Goal-oriented
• Retrieval vs. Generative (Deep Learning)

• Similar architecture, different stacks

Chatbot Approaches

Modern approaches

Pattern matching: Regex matching and response templates (canned responses)
Grounding: Knowledge graphs and inference on those graphs
Search: Text retrieval
Generative: Statistics and machine learning

Hybrid approaches
Using multiple (or all four) techniques in one bot

Bot Design Process

User Stories
• Develop pairs of user questions – expected answers
• Generalize multiple stories with the same theme

Development

• Identify appropriate technology for specific type of question
• Enhance bot based on approach (e.g., add data for retrieval)

Basic approach

Information Retrieval-based Approach
Given a corpus of previously answered questions
• Create tf-idf vector of the question
• Compute cosine similarity with either:

• tf-idf vectors of answers (if only answers available)
• tf-idf vectors of questions (if question/answer pairs available)

Example Dataset
1.4 million answered questions from Amazon:

Regular Expressions

Basic Concepts (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

Boolean "or": A vertical bar separates alternatives. For example, gray|grey can match
“gray” or “grey”.

Grouping: Parentheses are used to define the scope and precedence of the operators
(among other uses). For example, gray|grey and gr(a|e)y are equivalent
patterns which both describe the set of "gray" or "grey".

Quantification: A quantifier after a token (such as a character) or group specifies how often
that a preceding element is allowed to occur:

• ? The question mark indicates zero or one occurrences of the preceding
element. For example, colou?r matches both "color" and "colour".

• * The asterisk indicates zero or more occurrences of the preceding
element. For example, ab*c matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and
so on.

• + The plus sign indicates one or more occurrences of the preceding
element. For example, ab+c matches "abc", "abbc", "abbbc", and so on,
but not "ac".

• {n} The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
• {min,} The preceding item is matched min or more times.
• {min,max} The preceding item is matched at least min times, but not

more than max times.

Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML)

Towards Chatbot Frameworks
• Open standard, started in 1995 by Richard Wallace et al.
• Used in the A.L.I.C.E. chatbot (and many others)
• Using XML-based patterns
• AIML kernel loads patterns and responds when match is found

Example

<category>
<pattern>HELLO *</pattern>
<template>Hi, human!</template>

</category>
<category>
<pattern>WHAT IS YOUR NAME</pattern>
<template>I am ConUBot, your helpful assistant.</template>

Using aiml_bot

import aiml_bot
bot = aiml_bot.Bot(learn="conubot.aiml")

In : bot.respond("Hello Conubot!!!")
Out: ’Hi Human!’

Grounding

Adding Knowledge

• Using a knowledge base when creating answers
• More scalable than hard-coding every possible answer in patterns

From the lab exercises...

1 What is <X>?
E.g., “What is Concordia University?”

2 ⇒ query DBpedia to retrieve the rdfs:comment (in the user’s language) of X
Concordia University (commonly referred to as Concordia) is a public com-
prehensive university located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in
1974 following the merger of Loyola College and Sir George Williams Uni-
versity, Concordia is one of the three universities in Quebec where English
is the primary language of instruction.

Question Classification

Applying ML

• What we need is a classifier that takes a question as input and returns the type
as output

• This is a typical machine learning problem (supervised learning)

Feature Extraction

Feature Engineering
Need to convert text (here: question) into a feature vector
• Could use count or tf-idf vector
• but this results in a high number of dimensions (and possible overfitting)

Idea: Reduce Dimensions
Can we come up with some other features that can be easily extracted?
• Length (in words/characters)?
• Number of words with capital letters?
• Ends with question mark or not?
• Number of nouns/verbs?

Challenge: find features that facilitate classification.

Dimensionality reduction in NLP

Some common strategies

Stemming: reduce words to their stem (e.g., students, student⇒ student)
Stopword removal: remove stop-words (e.g., the, in, an, a, ...)

Tokenization

Task
• Split input stream of characters into individual tokens (words, numbers, etc.)
• Done by a Tokenizer (e.g., the default tokenizer in scikit-learn)

Tokenization can be difficult...
For example, biomedical documents with complex expressions, chemical formulas,
etc.:
• 1,4-β-xylanase II from Trichoderma reesei
• When N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) was injected. . .
• Technetium-99m-CDO-MeB [Bis[1,2-cyclohexanedione-dioximato(1-

)-O]-[1,2-cyclohexanedione dioximato(2-)-O]
methyl-borato(2-)-N,N′,N′′,N′′′,N′′′′,N′′′′′)-chlorotechnetium) belongs to a family
of compounds. . .

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging and Parsing

POS Tagging
Assign a POS tag (e.g., Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, ...) to each Token:

The/DT big/ADJ dog/NN

Can be done reliably, available in NLP libraries (e.g, spaCy or NLTK for Python).

Parsing
Create a tree representing a sentence’s grammatical structure

You can then extract subject or object, e.g., to use in a SPARQL query.

Competency Questions

Knowledge Base Design
Unlike (relational) databases, knowledge bases do not have a rigid, pre-defined
design for a specific application
• Encourage inter-connection of knowledge
• Still helpful to have an idea of possible use cases

Design Method

• Start with a set of questions to guide the design of the vocabulary and data
triples

• It must be possible to answer the questions when the knowledge base has
been constructed

• These competency questions can be seen as a requirements specification for a
vocabulary or knowledge base

Competency Questions: Examples

Examples
Some possible competency questions for a university knowledge graph:
Q1: Which courses are offered at University X?
Q2: Which topics are covered by a course C?
Q3: Which professors teach at university X?
Q4: What are the prerequisites for a given course C?
Q5: Which universities offer courses that cover topic T ?

Note
These mostly follow a single pattern

Which [CLASS1] [PROPERTY] [CLASS2]?

Testing Competency Questions

Example: African Wildlife Ontology (AWO)
Competency question awo_6 “Which plants eat animals?”
Verify using a SPARQL query:

SELECT DISTINCT ?eats
WHERE {

?eats rdfs:subClassOf awo:plant, [
a owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty awo:eats;
owl:someValuesFrom awo:animal

] .
FILTER(?eats != owl:Nothing)

}

See https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338424817_Dataset_of_ontology_c
ompetency_questions_to_SPARQL-OWL_queries_translations

Another approach: SHACL
There is also a separate standard, the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)
(https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/), see [HHDF20] for an example.

DBpedia Spotlight: Disambiguation

Approach
Spotlight uses a statistical model for disambiguation
• Using the context of a word/phrase
• Learned from the Wikipedia pages including the links (for multiple languages)

A 2012 paper reports a 85.1% accuracy for English (with 7.4% missing links)

Discussion
• Modern approaches for disambiguation use word embeddings (discussed later

in the course), with better performance
• However, Spotlight is a stable, easy-to-install tool and useful for first

experiments
