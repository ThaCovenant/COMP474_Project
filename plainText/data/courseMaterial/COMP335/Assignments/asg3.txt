Assignment 3

Submission through Moodle is due by Monday, October 16th at 23:55

1. [20 Points] Let Σ = {a, b}. For each of the following languages over Σ, first give a
regular expression for it, then give a regular grammar for it.

(a) {w ∈ Σ∗ : na(w) is divisible by 3 and every a in w is immediately

followed by at least one b}

(b) {w ∈ Σ∗ : na(w) is odd and nb(w) is also odd}

2. [20 Points] Let Σ = {a, b}. For each of the following languages over Σ, prove that the
language is regular

(a) L3 = {w ∈ Σ∗ : na(w) is divisible by 4 and w ends in aab}.
(b) L4 = {w ∈ Σ∗ : w does NOT contain a substring y ∈ L3}.

3. [20 Points] Use generalized transition graphs (GTG) to convert the following NFAs
(alphabet Σ = {a, b}) into regular expressions. Show your work, i.e., intermediate
GTGs.

4. [10 Points] Let Σ = {a, b}. Consider the function f defined as follows:

For w ∈ Σ∗ we have f(w) = ana(w)bnb(w),



or, in words, f rearranges input w so that all a’s precede all b’s.

For a language L, we define f(L) = {f(w) : w ∈ L}, that is we form f(L) by applying
f to every string in L. Consider the following statement:

If L is regular then f(L) is regular.

Clearly, state whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE, and prove your answer.

5. [20 Points] For each of the following languages, prove that it is not regular using the
pumping lemma.

(a) L = {w ∈ {a, b, c}∗ : na(w) = nb(w) + nc(w)}.
(b) L = {anbk : n ≥ k3}
