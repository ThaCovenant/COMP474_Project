Assignment 1

Submission through moodle is due by Sunday, September 17th at 23:59

1. [10 Points] Let L be any language over an alphabet Σ. Prove or disprove each of the
following statements about L+?

(a) L+ is finite only if L = ∅.
(b) L+ = L∗ − L0.

2. [15 Points] LetG be a grammar with the start variable S and the following productions:

S → aaA | λ
A → bS

(a) Give a simple description of the language L(G) generated by grammar G above.

(b) Show a derivation of the string w = aabaab from G.

(c) Suppose L = {w : w ∈ L(G) and |w| ≤ 10}. What is LR, the reverse of L?

3. [15 Points] For each of the following languages over {0, 1}, give a DFA that accepts it.

(a) La = {w : w begins with 0}
(b) Lb = {w : w ends with 11}
(c) Lc = {w : w either begins with 0 or ends with 00, but not both}

4. [10 Points] Design a DFA that accepts every string w over {a, b} in which every a is
followed by one or two b’s but not more.

5. [10 Points] Design a DFA that accepts every string w over the alphabet {a, b, c} in
which no two consecutive symbols are the same.

6. [10 Points] Design a DFA that accepts all positive decimal integers that are not divisible
by 3. The positive decimal integers considered in this context is defined as a sequence
of decimal digits that do not start with 0. Examples of strings that are accepted by
this DFA include: 1, 4, 88, · · ·, and examples of strings that are not accepted include:
0, 3, 12, 999, 00, 001, 003, · · ·.
