Submission through moodle is due by Sunday, December 3rd at 23:55

1. [10 points] Let L be a Deterministic CFL over an alphabet Σ. Let f1(L) = L1 = {w :
wa ∈ L, for some a ∈ Σ} and f2(L) = L2 = {w : aw ∈ L for some a ∈ Σ}. Only one
of L1 and L2 is guaranteed to be a DCFL. Which one? Justify your answer.

2. [40 points] For each of the following 4 languages L, determine to which of the following
categories L belongs: (i) regular (ii) context-free but not regular, and (iii) not context-
free. To show that L belongs to category (ii), you need to show two things: (1) L is
CF and (2) L is not regular.

(a) L1 = {wuwR : w, u ∈ {a, b}∗}
(b) L2 = {wuwR : w, u ∈ {a, b}⋆, |w| = |u|}
(c) L3 = {w1cw2 : w1 ̸= wR

2 , w1, w2 ∈ {a, b}∗}
(d) L4 = {anbjckdl : n ≤ k, j ≤ l}

3. [20 points] Design standard Turing machines that accept the following languages. In
each case, draw the transition diagram of your TM and give a brief description in
English of your design strategy.

(a) L5 = {ww : w ∈ {a, b}⋆}
(b) L6 = {wuwR : w, u ∈ {a, b}⋆, |w| = |u|}

4. [20 points] Draw transition diagrams for standard Turing machines that compute the
following functions. In each case, briefly describe in English your design strategy.

(a) f1(1
n01m) = 1|m−n|

(b) f2(0
n) = 0k, where k ≡ n(mod3)
