Submission through Moodle is due by Sunday, November 5th at 23:55

1. [10 Points] For each CFG G below, describe L(G):

(a) S → EaS | E
E → aEb | bEa | EE | λ

(b) S → aSd | A | B | C
A → aAc | C
B → bBd | C
C → bCc | λ

2. [15 Points] For each of the languages below, prove that the language is context-free:

(a) {vwvR : v, w ∈ {a, b}+ and |w| = 3}.
(b) {w ∈ {a, b, c}∗ : |w| = 5na(w) + 2nb(w)}.
(c) {r : r is valid regular expression over the alphabet Σ = {a, b, c}}.

3. [15 Points] For each pair (G,w) below, draw a derivation tree to show that w ∈ L(G):

(a) G : S → aSb | bSa | SS | λ, and w = aabbbabbaa.

(b) G :
S → aSb | A | B
A → aAa | C
B → bBb | C
C → bCa | λ
and w = aaabaabb.

(c) G : your answer to Q2(c), and w = (aa∗ + b)∗(c+ λ).

4. [12 Points] Convert the following CFG G into a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) by
following the steps below:

S → ASBB | a | b
A → AaA | AB | λ
B → BbB | BA | λ
C → ABB

(a) Remove λ-productions from G.



(b) Remove unit-productions from the grammar in your answer to (a).

(c) Remove useless-productions from the grammar in your answer to (b).

(d) Finish the conversion of the grammar in your answer to (c) to the CNF.
