Assignment 5

Submission through moodle is due by Sunday, November 19th at 23:59

1. [40 points] For each of the following languages, give a context-free grammar:

(a) L1 = {abnabna : n ≥ 0}
(b) L2 = {anbmck : k = m+ n}
(c) L3 = {aibjck : i = j or i = k}
(d) L4 = {ww : w ∈ L(0∗10∗)}

2. [10 points] Give a CFG for the complement of L5 = {anbn+1 : n ≥ 0}.

3. [30 points] For each of the following CFLs L, give a “direct” design of an NPDA. That
is, it is not acceptable to first find a CFG and then convert it into an NPDA.

(a) L6 = {anb3n : n ≥ 0}
(b) L7 = {anbm : 0 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 3n}
(c) L8 = {w ∈ {a, b}∗ : na(w) ≤ 3nb(w)}
