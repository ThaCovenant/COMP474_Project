Regular expressions and grammars

1. Let Σ = {a, b}. Give regular expressions for the following languages over Σ.

(a) L1 = {w | w ends with the string ab}
(b) L2 = {w | w contains the string aba}
(c) L3 = {w | w contains exactly one a}
(d) L4 = {anbm | n + m is even }
(e) L5 = {anbm | n ≥ 3,m is even }
(f) L6 = {w | |w| mod 3 = 1}
(g) L7 = {w | w has no consecutive a’s}
(h) L8 = {w | w has at least one pair of consecutive a’s}
(i) L9 = {w | w has exactly one pair of consecutive a’s }
(j) L10 = {w | w has no runs of a’s of length > 2}

2. Given a regular expression r, find a regular expression for reverse(r).

3. Find NFAs for the languages below:

(a) L(ab(a + ab)?(a + aa))

(b) L((a + b)?b(a + bb)?)

4. Find DFAs for the languages below and then convert each of them into a regular expression or vice versa:

(a) {w ∈ (a + b)? | na(w) and nb(w) are both odd.}
(b) {w ∈ (a + b)? | the leftmost two symbols of w are the same as the rightmost two symbols }

5. Give right-linear grammars for all the languages in Q1.

6. Consider the language L = {w ∈ (a + b)? | the string aba does not appear in w}.

(a) Give a DFA that accepts L.

(b) Convert it into an equivalent right regular grammar.

(c) Find a regular expression for L = {a, b}? − L.
