Normal Forms for Context-Free Grammars

1. Convert the following grammar to Chomsky Normal Form:

S → ABAC | BaA
A→ Aa | BAbC | λ
B → bB | aBaC | λ
C → a | b

2. A variable A is called useless if either (a) it does not generate any string of terminals, or if (b) it is not
possible to generate a string containing A from the start variable S. Does it matter in which order we
remove such useless variables?

3. If we first remove unit productions, and then λ-productions, is the resulting grammar guaranteed to have
neither unit nor λ-productions?

4. If we first remove useless productions, then unit productions, is the resulting grammar guaranteed to have
niether useless nor unit productions?

5. A production is called left recursive if it is of the form A → Ax for some x ∈ (V ∪ T )∗. Consider the
grammar S → Sa | b. Show how to rewrite the grammar so that it contains no left-recursive rules.

6. Convert the following grammar to Griebach Normal Form:

S → AA | a
A→ BB | b

7. Suppose G is a grammar in CNF, and let w ∈ L(G) with |w| = n. What is the length of a derivation of w
in G?

8. Suppose G is a grammar in GNF, and let w ∈ L(G) with |w| = n. What is the length of a derivation of w
in G?
