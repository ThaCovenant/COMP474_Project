The Pumping Lemma:
there exists an integer        such that 
for any string  
we can write
For infinite context-free language 
with lengths
and it must be:

Theorem:
The language
is not context free
Proof:
Use the Pumping Lemma
for context-free languages

COMP 335



COMP 335
*
Assume for contradiction that
is context-free
Since         is context-free and infinite
we can apply the pumping lemma

Pumping Lemma gives a magic number
such that:  
Pick any string of       with length at least  
we pick:

We can write:
with lengths                      and
Pumping Lemma says:

We examine all the possible locations
of string            in

Case 4:





Analysis is similar to case 3

More cases:
overlaps

or

Analysis is similar to cases 2,3,4:


COMP 335






COMP 335
*
 Since                 , it is impossible
         to overlap:
There are no other cases to consider

nor

In all cases we obtained a contradiction
Therefore:
The original assumption that 
is context-free must be wrong
Conclusion:
